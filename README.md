This is one of two README files with infomation about the application.
Take note that the final build for EB is in the www folder.
Furthermore, only certain sites allow image/link scrapping, I recommend using images/links from pexels.com
if a site doesnt support it you will find that it throws an error.

Kindly read the other README in deployment_screenshots it has info pertaining to the EB instance outcome.

Also npm i if you want to test the application out.
